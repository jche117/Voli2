# Completed Actions

This document summarizes the key actions and features implemented during our session.

## Summary for August 15, 2025

### Dynamic Task Management (Task Templating)
- **Backend**: Implemented a full-featured task templating system.
  - Created a new `TaskTemplate` model and associated database tables to store dynamic form schemas.
  - Added a new set of API endpoints for full CRUD management of task templates.
  - Enhanced the core `Task` model and services to support `template_id` and `custom_data` fields, including validation of custom data against the template schema.
- **Frontend**: Built the user interface for managing and using task templates.
  - Created a new "Template Manager" in the admin panel (`/admin/templates`) for creating, editing, and deleting task templates.
  - Developed a dynamic form builder within the template manager to allow administrators to define custom fields (e.g., text, date, select), including the ability to specify options for `select` (dropdown) fields.
  - Overhauled the `TaskForm` to be template-driven. It now allows users to select a template and dynamically renders the appropriate custom fields, with improved UI for `datetime` fields using `datetime-local` input.
  - Updated the main task view to display all custom data associated with a task.

## Summary for August 14, 2025 (Adjusted â€“ previously future-dated)

### Task Management Feature (End-to-End)
- **Backend**: Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks.
  - Created service functions in `services.py` to handle all database interactions for the `tasks` module.
  - Built secure API endpoints in `router.py` for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks, with authorization checks for users and administrators.
- **Frontend**: Developed the user interface for task management.
  - Added task-related functions (`getTasks`, `createTask`, etc.) to the API library in `lib/api.ts`.
  - Created a new page at `/dashboard/tasks` to display a user's tasks.
  - Built a reusable `TaskForm.tsx` component in a modal for creating and editing tasks.
  - The UI allows users to view, add, edit, and delete their tasks.

### Frontend: Detailed Registration Form
- **Expanded Form**: Replaced the simple registration form with a comprehensive, multi-section form in `RegisterForm.tsx` that captures all fields from the `Contact` database model.
- **API Client**: Created a centralized API client using `axios` in `lib/api.ts` to standardize frontend-to-backend communication.
- **Dependency Management**: Added the `axios` package to the frontend application.

### Backend: API and Schema Updates
- **Updated Schemas**: Refactored the `UserCreate` and `ContactCreate` Pydantic schemas to accept a nested structure, allowing for detailed contact information to be passed during user registration.
- **Database Migration**: Added a `date_of_birth` field to the `Contact` model and generated the corresponding Alembic migration.
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrected a port mismatch in the frontend's `.env.local` file and fixed a typo in the backend's `/token` endpoint.

### Project Maintenance
- **Code Cleanup**: Identified and recommended the removal of a duplicate `schemas.py` file from the project root to improve project structure and clarity.
- **Documentation**: Updated `todo.md` to mark baseline task CRUD + basic UI complete (advanced dashboard pending).

## Summary for August 14, 2025

### Frontend: Dashboard UI Overhaul & Profile Feature
- **Dashboard Header**:
  - Created a new reusable `Header.tsx` component for the main dashboard view.
  - Integrated the `lucide-react` library for icons.
  - Added interactive icons for Settings, Roles, Profile, and Logout.
  - Implemented a dropdown menu for the "Roles" icon to display the current user's roles from the auth context.
- **User Profile Modal**:
  - Created a `ProfileModal.tsx` component that displays a detailed view of the logged-in user's contact information.
  - The modal is triggered by the "Profile" icon in the new header.
  - It fetches data from a new, dedicated backend endpoint.
- **Authentication & Page Structure**:
  - Created a `withAuth.tsx` Higher-Order Component (HOC) to standardize route protection and ensure a user is logged in.
  - Refactored the `/dashboard` page to use the `withAuth` HOC and the central `AuthContext`, replacing outdated, manual token-handling logic.

### Backend: API Enhancements & Bug Fixes
- **New Endpoint**: Added a secure `/api/v1/users/me/contact` endpoint to allow a logged-in user to fetch their own associated contact details.
- **Registration Fix**: Updated the user registration logic in `main.py` to automatically create and link a `Contact` record when a new `User` is created. This resolves the issue where new users had no profile information.

### Build & Configuration
- **Dependency Management**: Added `lucide-react` to the frontend dependencies.
- **Troubleshooting**: Resolved multiple "Module not found" build errors by creating the required component files (`withAuth.tsx`, `ProfileModal.tsx`, `Header.tsx`).

## Summary for August 13, 2025

### Admin Panel & Role Management
- **Fixed Admin Page Access**: Resolved an issue where clicking the "administrator" role link in the header redirected back to the main page. The `AdminPage` component was incorrectly checking for an old `is_admin` JWT claim; it has been updated to correctly check for the `administrator` role in the `roles` array.
- **Fixed User Table API Endpoint**: Corrected a `404 Not Found` error on the admin page's user table. The frontend was calling `/api/v1/admin/users/`, which was updated to the correct endpoint, `/api/v1/users/`.
- **Fixed User Table Authorization**: Resolved a `405 Method Not Allowed` error by updating the backend `read_users` endpoint. The permission check was changed from an outdated `get_current_admin_user` function to the new `RoleChecker(['administrator'])`, ensuring only admins can access the user list.
- **Fixed User Data Serialization**: Fixed a `500 Internal Server Error` that occurred when fetching the user list. The backend's Pydantic `User` schema was outdated and still referenced old fields like `is_admin`. The schema was updated to correctly serialize the new `roles` relationship, resolving the error.
- **Implemented Role Management API Functions**: Added `getRoles`, `assignRoleToUser`, and `revokeRoleFromUser` functions to the frontend's API library (`lib/api.ts`) to support the user management table.

  - `middle_name`, `preferred_name`
  - `personal_email`, `secondary_phone_number`
  - `postal_address`
  - `gender`, `membership_id`, `organizational_unit`, `region`, `usi_number`
  - `preferred_contact_method`, `blue_card_number`, `license_number`
